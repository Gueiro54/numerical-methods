# numerical-methods
This is my first JS project, where I built a application that can apply diverse numerical methods (The ones I learned in college). I just started it, so it accounts only with a numerical method, which is Newton-Raphson method.
I want to make it has at leat 5 diffent methods and upgrade CSS code to make it nicer.
